
Hi, 

I am yazan and this is my tasl

after running the project 

you can check the swagger using 


http://localhost:${port from env}/v1/docs/static/index.html


here are my env now

DEBUG=true
NODE_ENV=development
API_HOST=http://localhost:8080
FRONT_HOST=
API_PORT=8080
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT="5432"
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_NAME=data
DB_USERNAME=postgres
JWT_SECRET="lku$h47mf%m1kue&kf2"
JWT_EXPIRE=15d
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE=30d
ADMIN_PASSWORD=rootroot


to view the html file

you need  "live server" extenction

then right click on the html file from vs code 

then click on "open wth live server"

please login in swagger then you can add the token in order to save it in local storage 

then you can add , edit , delete , change password of users

if you want to login with another user
to check the perms

login with swagger then add the token as i did mention above
